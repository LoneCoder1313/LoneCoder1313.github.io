I decide to study software engineering, because I always found it interesting that a programmer can create  digital , of there own.  Creating apps and fixing programs struck a strong interest in high school, but I did not pursue anything intill now, its always been in the back of my mind that I could always do more So I finally decided to step out of my comfort zone and to learn programming I strongly think I have a future in this field, so I am making it a reality.
