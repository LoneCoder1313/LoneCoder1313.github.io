  Being new to coding I get stuck often, So what I always do before asking for help is I hit the web and start googling what I'm working on at that moment such as instance methods or hash anything. I think when you reading information on a topic your stuck on  from different soruces it gives you a wider range on the topic and can help a lot. Some great sites to take into account are: https://stackoverflow.com/   stack overflow has a great board that answers a lot of questions in coding , https://repl.it/   I recently started using repl its more like a coding sandbox or playgound where you can share your work and view other peoples work. https://www.sololearn.com/ sololearn is great aswell  has a coding sandbox as well as a message forum where other programmers can talk to each other and share work. Hope this helps you out like it helps me out.
